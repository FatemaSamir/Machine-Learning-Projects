# Description:

This project is a credit card application predictor implemented to automate the analysis of credit card applications received by commercial banks.
The manual analysis of applications is tedious, error-prone, and time-consuming. To address these challenges, this project utilizes machine learning techniques to
build an automatic credit card approval predictor, similar to the systems employed by real banks.

The project utilizes the Credit Card Approval dataset <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval>  from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset comprises a mix of numerical and non-numerical features, with values spanning different ranges and containing missing entries. Therefore, data preprocessing is performed to ensure the chosen machine learning model can make accurate predictions.

The project follows a structured approach, beginning with loading and viewing the dataset. Through exploratory data analysis, insights are gained to guide the decision-making process. Finally, a machine learning model is built to predict whether an individual's credit card application will be accepted.

Overall, this project demonstrates the power of machine learning in automating and optimizing credit card approval processes, benefiting both commercial banks and applicants.
